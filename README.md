# dcss
generate rc for dcss

```sh
# Edit `_template.rc` and/or associated `parts` files
yarn compile
# That's it! Your customized RC is now on your clipboard ready for pasting
```

## Coming Soon...
- Prettier format for `AnnounceDamage.lua`
  - `[HP(+X)/MHP][MP(+X)/MMP]`

- Automatic RC updating
  - ...can we see what endpoint the app is calling when we save the rc on web tiles?
  - maybe we can programmatically update the rc as we make edits so that we don't have to edit files, build, open web app, copy paste, save, etc.
