rc for dcss

## magusnn.rc

## TODO

- Format `announce_damage`
  - `[HP(+X)/MHP][MP(+X)/MMP]`

- Automatic RC update
  - ...can we see what endpoint the app is calling when we save the rc on web tiles?
  - maybe we can programmatically update the rc as we make edits so that we don't have to edit files, build, open web app, copy paste, save, etc.
