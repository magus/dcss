##### Crawl Init file ###############################################
# For descriptions of all options, as well as some more in-depth information
# on setting them, consult the file
#    options_guide.txt
# in your /docs directory. If you can't find it, the file is also available
# online at:
# https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/options_guide.txt
#
# Crawl uses the first file of the following list as its option file:
#  * init.txt in the -rcdir directory (if specified)
#  * .crawlrc in the -rcdir directory (if specified)
#  * init.txt (in the Crawl directory)
#  * ~/.crawl/init.txt (Unix only)
#  * ~/.crawlrc (Unix only)
#  * ~/init.txt (Unix only)
#  * settings/init.txt (in the Crawl directory)

##### Some basic explanation of option syntax #######################
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments. The basic syntax is:
#
# field = value         or      field.subfield = value
#
# Only one specification is allowed per line.
#
# The terms are typically case-insensitive except in the fairly obvious
# cases (the character's name and specifying files or directories when
# on a system that has case-sensitive filenames).
#
# White space is stripped from the beginning and end of the line, as
# well as immediately before and after the '='. If the option allows
# multiple comma/semicolon-separated terms (such as
# autopickup_exceptions), all whitespace around the separator is also
# trimmed. All other whitespace is left intact.
#
# There are three broad types of Crawl options: true/false values (booleans),
# arbitrary values, and lists of values. The first two types use only the
# simple =, with later options - which includes your options that are different
# from the defaults - overriding earlier ones. List options allow using +=, ^=,
# -=, and = to append, prepend, remove, and reset, respectively. Usually you will
# want to use += to add to a list option. Lastly, there is := which you can use
# to create an alias, like so:
#   ae := autopickup_exceptions
# From there on, 'ae' will be treated as if it you typed autopickup_exceptions,
# so you can save time typing it.
#

##### Other files ###################################################
# You can include other files from your options file using the 'include'
# option. Crawl will treat it as if you copied the whole text of that file
# into your options file in that spot. You can uncomment some of the following
# lines by removing the beginning '#' to include some of the other files in
# this folder.

# Some useful, more advanced options, implemented in LUA.
# include = advanced_optioneering.txt

################################################################################################
# When set to `true` or `full`, the game will pregenerate the entire
# connected dungeon when starting a new character. This leads to
# deterministic dungeon generation relative to a particular game seed, at
# the cost of a slow game start. If set to `incremental`, the game will
# generate levels as needed so that it always generates them in the same
# order, also producing a deterministic dungeon. You still may encounter
# variation in bazaars, the abyss, pandemonium, and ziggurats, and for
# incremental pregeneration, artefacts. When set to `false` or `classic`,
# the game will generate all levels on level entry, as was the rule before
# 0.23. Some servers may disallow full pregeneration.
# https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/options_guide.txt#L421

# Sorting #
###########
# sort_menus = [menu:](true | false | auto:X)[:sort_order]
#         Controls if and how items are sorted in inventory and pickup
#         menus.

#         When sort_menus = false (the default), items are not sorted, and
#         will be ordered by inventory letter (or in the order they're
#         stacked for items on the floor).

#         When sort_menus = true, items are sorted according to the specified
#         sort_order, with the default being:
#              equipped, basename, qualname, curse, qty

#         If sort_menus = auto:X, items are sorted if there are at least
#         X items in the same category. For instance:
#              sort_menus = auto:5
#         will sort item classes that have at least 5 items. For instance,
#         having 4 kinds of potions would not sort them, but having 5
#         would.

#         You can explicitly specify sort criteria in the sort_menus
#         option as:
#              sort_menus = true : art, basename, qualname, curse, qty

#         Two items will be compared based on the first sort criteria
#         where they differ. So with the sort_menus line given above,
#         if only one of two different items is a known artefact, it will be
#         listed first, else (if both or neither are artefacts) if their
#         basenames are different they will be alphabetically compared using
#         their basenames; if the basenames are the same but the qualified
#         names are different it will compare their qualified names, and so
#         on.

#         The available sort criteria are:

#         * basename:
#           This is the name of the item type. The basename for all of
#           "a +0 robe", "an embroidered robe" and "the cursed +2 robe of
#           Ponies" is just "robe". The basename for both of "a brass
#           ring" and "a ring of fire resistance" are "ring".

#         * qualname:
#           The name of the item without articles (a/an/the), quantities,
#           enchantments, or curse-status. The qualified names for the
#           robes described above are "robe", "embroidered robe" and "robe
#           of Ponies", respectively. The qualified names for the rings
#           described above are "brass ring" and "ring of fire
#           resistance", respectively.

#         * fullname:
#           This is the name of the item as displayed in menus (including
#           (quantities, curse-status, etc.)

#         * dbname:
#           Sorts based on an item's unique internal name which is linked
#           to its description. Items with the same description will be
#           grouped together.

#         * curse:
#           Curse-status of the item (if known). Uncursed items show up
#           first.

#         * equipped:
#           Equipped items show up first.

#         * art:
#           Identified artefacts show up first.

#         * ego:
#           Identified ego items show up first.

#         * glowing:
#           Unidentified glowing/shiny/runed/etc items show up first.

#         * identified:
#           Identified items show up before unidentified ones of the
#           same type. An item is regarded as identified once you know
#           its subtype or ego.

#         * qty:
#           The quantity for stackable items (such as scrolls, potions,
#           etc.)

#         * slot:
#           The inventory letter for items in inventory; irrelevant for
#           items on the floor.

#         * charged:
#           Makes wands known or assumed to have some charges left appear
#           before wands known to be empty; irrelevant for all other item
#           types.

#         You can ask for a descending order sort by prefixing one or more
#         sort criteria with > as:
#              sort_menus = true : basename, >qty

#         You can also request sorting only for specific menus:
#              sort_menus = pickup: true
#         or
#              sort_menus = inv: true
#         (Menu types must be specified as name:, with no space between
#         name and colon.)

#         By default only pickup menus are sorted, and the sort criteria are:
#              "equipped, basename, qualname, curse, qty".
#         All other menus (drop, inv) will be sorted by inventory letter.

#         The menu selectors available are:

#         pickup: All pickup menus, stash-search menus, etc. for items not
#                 in your inventory.
#         drop:   The item drop menu.
#         inv:    Inventory listings for any command (but not for dropping
#                 items).
#         any:    All menus; this is the default when unspecified.

#         For example,
#              sort_menus = true : equipped, basename, qualname, curse, qty
#         will produce the same inventory and drop menus as by default,
#         with the exception that all worn/wielded items come first. This
#         can be convenient if you use the '.' command to select
#         subsequent items.
#         If you define sort_menus differently for two or more selectors,
#         the last one matching will always take precedence, i.e. "any"
#         as last setting would override any of the others.

# for all menus (unspecified)
# ignore equipped status for sorting
sort_menus = true : identified , curse , art , ego , basename , qualname, >qty
# sort equipped items to top
# sort_menus = true : equipped , identified , curse , art , ego , basename , qualname, >qty
# sort by quantity first
# sort_menus = true : >qty , identified , curse , art , ego , basename , qualname, equipped, >qty
